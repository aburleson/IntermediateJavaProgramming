Write a short Java program that does some input, some output, and some calculations. Think of it as a Java refresher 
problem in case it has been awhile since you've done any Java programming.

This program should set up a loop and keep requesting input until the user enters an asterisk (*). Each line you enter 
that has data should contain a floating-point number.

Once the user ends the input with an asterisk, display three items: a count of the number of entries, the total of all 
the numbers, and the average of all the numbers.


Answer:


import java.util.Scanner;

  

public class Assignment1 

{

      public static void main(String[] args) 

      {

        boolean truckOn = true;

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        double denverPlayer = 0.0;

        int numberCount = 0;

        double numberTotal = 0.0;

  

        System.out.println("This program will ask you to enter in the number of any Denver Bronco player.");

        System.out.println("It continues until you enter an asterisk (*).  Then it will display information");

        System.out.println("on the numbers entered for viewing purposes.\n");

  

        while (truckOn) 

        {

            System.out.print("Enter a Denver Bronco Player Number: ");

  

            if (input.hasNextDouble())

                  if (input.next().equals("18"))

                  {

                        System.out.println("\nLooks like we have a Peyton Manning fan!\n");

                        denverPlayer = input.nextDouble();

                    numberCount++;

                    numberTotal += denverPlayer;

                  }

                  else

                  {

                denverPlayer = input.nextDouble();

                numberCount++;

                numberTotal += denverPlayer;

                  }

                  

            else if (input.next().equals("*")) 

            {

                truckOn = false;

                System.out.println("\nYou entered " + numberCount + " numbers.");

                System.out.println("Total: " + numberTotal);

                System.out.println("Average: " + (numberTotal / numberCount));

            }

            

            else 

            {

                System.out.println("\n This is an invalid input.");

            }

        }

    }

}
