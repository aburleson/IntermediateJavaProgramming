For your Lesson 2 assignment, I would like you to use an array to figure out which day of the week is the best for a 
fictional business. Write a program to ask a user for sales information. For each sale, have the user enter the day of the 
week and the amount of the sale. Store total sales for each day of the week in an array, and after the last sale is entered, 
list the sales for each day and tell which day had the highest sales.
